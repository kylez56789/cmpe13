Lab Summary:

I think the most important parts of this lab was the utilization of a stack and learning how to create one. 
Additionally, it was important that we learned to use string modifiers like strcpy, strtok, strcat, etc. This
lab also gave us additional practice on unit testing. This lab had a wide variety of functions and bugs that 
were everywhere. The error handling portion of the lab was also crucial because all the different corner cases
needed to be covered or else the calculator would prove to have a lot of problems.

Approach:

My approach to this lab was pretty simple. I started by working on stack.c to make the stack so I could use it
inside the RPN_Evaluate function. The stack functions weren't super difficult and were pretty easy to test. 
Afterwards, I started working on the RPN_Evaluate which at first didn't seem too hard but later proved to be 
more difficult than I expected. There wasn't much information on the manual, I just went off of my logic as 
well as the information on the header files. I thought my strategy worked pretty well, I just had a few bugs
that took a while for me to fix. If I were to redo this lab, I would probably try to not overthink everything
and make my code simpler.

Implementation:

This lab was pretty hard in the end. I thought I was almost finished for the most part, but then later I found
out I had a lot of bugs to fix. The test harnesses for stack and rpn were pretty annoying to do as well. Though
I didn't spend an absurd amount of time on this lab, it was a struggle near the end since I had some bugs to fix.
I think the hardest parts were the fact that there wasn't that much information in the lab manual and some bugs
I had were super weird. I think the lab manual had less information, but the header files had enough information
for me to get started on the lab. I think the grade distribution was pretty fair and the TA's were very helpful.
