Highlights of the lab:

I think the most important part of this lab was the unit testing part, not even the matrix math part. For most
of us including me, I've never needed to write my own test file for my code, so I was pretty confused on
what I needed to do at first. However, I think that this is the most important takeaway from this lab because
in the future, there will probably be no one to test your code, so you will have to write your own tests for
any code you write.

Approach to the lab:

Despite what most people would do which is write one function and then test it, I wasn't sure about how to write
the test file so I did all the functions first. This wasn't much of a big deal because I ended up being able
to test each function later on. I was stuck on MatrixSubmatrix for a long time because there was a bug I 
couldn't figure out. Eventually, I found out that I was calling the function with a 3x3 result array while the
function was supposed to take in a 2x2 which caused a memory error. After that, I was able to use MatrixSubmatrix
to write MatrixDeterminant and MatrixInverse. I didn't work on the lab with anyone else, I only got some help
at the lab sections.

Feedback:

I didn't spend that much time on this lab. I had it put aside for a while because there was a bug I couldn't 
figure out. I liked the concept of matrices because I'm taking linear algebra. The test file was pretty rough
since I've never made one before, but it ended up being just busy work. I think the grading seems appropriately
distributed. I think there was enough information on the header file and the lab manual for me to get started 
on the lab. I think the readings and the examples in class were very helpful in teaching me all I needed for 
this lab.
