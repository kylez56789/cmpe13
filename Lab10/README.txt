Summary: 
This lab was important because it helped me learn to use Unix, which is what I'm expected to know how to use for
some of the other CSE classes. In addition, I learned how to use functions working with files such as fopen, fclose
, fseek, etc. It was really nice to get off MPLabX and do something different for a change. I thought the most
important part was learning how to use Unix, how to send files to the server, and how to create a makefile since
these were all new encounters for most of us.


Approach:
My general approach to this lab was to really understand how the room files were formatted. After that, the 
rest of it was just logic. I think the lab manual was good but I got most of my information from piazza. 
I think the makefile was hard to figure out at first, but I ended up getting it and it worked out well. I was
struggling to figure out what the functions in Game.h were supposed to do, but I ended up figuring it out and 
it wasn't too hard after that. I collaborated with Allen just about the point of the lab and what each function 
was supposed to do, and that was pretty helpful. I think the lab went pretty well considering I was exhausted 
from finals. I think I would do this lab much earlier so I wouldn't have to stress so much about it after finals.

Implementation:
I ended up spending around 10 hours on this lab even though I think it should've taken less time. I had trouble
understanding how to do the lab at first, but once I got into a rhythm, it was fine. I didn't like how I had to
do a lab after my finals, but I liked that it was much easier and managable than most of the other labs we did.
The hardest part for me was understanding the Game.h functions, but after that, implementing then wasn't too hard.
I think there wasn't much information, so it was kind of hard to start. Piazza was very helpful, and I was
able to get a lot of information off of that. The grading seems fair, and there is nothing I would change
for this lab. I think it was worthwhile as well.
