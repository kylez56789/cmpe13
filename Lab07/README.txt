Summary: 
I think the lab was a pretty important second embedded lab. Not only did it cover finite state machines, it 
also covered topics like macro defined functions, switch/case statements, and review of material covered by the
last lab. I think the lab manual was very helpful in summarizing how finite state machines worked, and the 
diagram was really helpful, giving me a visual picture of the states and the transitions.

Approach:
My approach was quite simple. I followed the state machine diagram, which basically told me how my switch/case
statements would go. My buttons were messing up when I was trying to finish the lab, which caused me to freak
out because it would mess up all my other states. However, I figured it out and was able to finish the lab. I
think I understood this lab pretty well, it just took more time than I thought it would due to some small bugs.
If I were to do this lab again, I would definitely know how to construct a switch statement and I would be able
to come up with my own states and transitions instead of relying on the diagram given. I worked with another
student, but all we collaborated about was really how to use the TIMER_TICK flag. The rest of the lab was given
in the diagram basically, so we didn't need to discuss much more.

Implementation:
I think the lab went pretty well since I understood what I had to do most of the time. I spent a little over
10 hours on this lab, meaning it was not too bad. I liked the features of this lab and the topic because
making a small toaster on a microcontroller is so cool. There was nothing I disliked about this lab because
it was all around a fantastic lab and wasn't too hard. I would not change this lab much, but adding more features
to the oven might be fun. I think the hardest part was determining how to do the transitions between states. The
grade distribution seemed very reasonable and covered the important parts of the lab. The lab manual and class
lectures were very helpful in my success of this lab because they explained state machines well enough for me 
to get the lab done.

Implementation of the Extra Credit:
I used the timers concept from Lab 6 to implement the extra credit. First, I created and staggered 2 timers,
and essentially used the timeRemaning and event features of the timers to alternate between calling the Inverted
function and the Normal function. I then just added a if statement checking to see if a button 4 press was detected.
