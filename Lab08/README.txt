Summary:
This lab introduced the concepts of binary trees and was review of state machines as well as pointers. We were
required to use malloc to create the binary tree and use pointers when getting to the left or right nodes. I
thought the lab manual was very clear on the purpose of this lab and the difficult parts of this lab, as it
gave a diagram of the state machine for MorseCheckEvents as well as the binary tree for MorseInit. Using these
resources, the lab wasn't too difficult.

Approach:
Similar to the other labs, I scanned the lab manual for a summary of the concepts needed for the lab. I started
on BinaryTree.c and after testing those functions, moved onto Morse.c. After testing Morse.c, the main.c was almost
the same as the test harness for Morse.c, just printing to the Oled instead of Coolterm. I think everything worked
pretty well, and I was able to use experience from the past labs to make this lab much easier. If I were to do
this lab again, I don't think my approach would be any different. The state machine diagram basically told me
how to do MorseCheckEvents, and I used my experience with ButtonsCheckEvents from the previous labs to do
MorseCheckEvents. I didn't work with anyone on this lab.

Implementation:
This lab was pretty easy overall, and I wish I started earlier so I could finish earlier and not need to use
late hours. I ended up spending maybe 10 hours on this lab, which was much less time than the previous labs. 
I think this lab was pretty worthwhile because the product was a very fun and interesting program. I think in
the future, the lab manual shouldn't contain the state machine diagram for MorseCheckEvents because that diagram
basically gives away how to make that function. The lab manual and header files were clear and provided enough
information to help me finish the lab.
