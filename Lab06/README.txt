Summary:
This lab was our first lab mainly focused on event driven programming. Since this was a very new topic to most,
learning how to determine whether an event occured was probably the most important part of this lab. Interrupts
are also super important because it is what your code is mainly based off of. Other than these two concepts,
just getting to know how to use the different parts of the board was very important.

Approach:
I thought this lab wasn't going to be that hard. I was mistaken. I really wanted to finish this lab early, but 
I had no idea where to start. Once I went to lab section and got some information about how to do LEDS_INIT, I
took off from there. The lab manual did have a lot of information that was very helpful. After timers, adc and
switches weren't too hard. But buttons, buttons was a nightmare. I spent so long on buttons only to find out 
that my problem was so minimal. I put my flag reset outside my if statement which was causing many errors. If I
were to do this lab again, I would spend less time overthinking my bugs. The TA's were very helpful for this 
lab.

Results:
I spend a great deal of time on this lab. I was stuck on buttons.c for many hours only to find out it was just
a small bug. I liked how this lab was relatively simple and not too overcomplicated. I don't like how we had
to dive into embedded so fast, but I guess that is the important part of this class. I think the lab was quite
worthwhile since it was too hard but also taught the basics very well. The hardest part was definitely buttons.c.
The grading seemed reasonable and I gained alot of information form class lectures as well as lab sections.
